#File names downloaded into R
<X_train> ... training set data
<y_train> ... training label names
<subject_train> ... list of test names from "X_train" & "y_train" data sets
<X_test> ... test set data
<y_test> ... test label names
<subject_test> ... list of test names from "X_test" & "y_test" data sets
<activity_labels> ... list of activities tested in training and test data sets
<features> ... list of all features of included datasets

#Combined data set vectors
<all_test> ... vector from c-binding "X_test", "y_test", and "subject_test" data sets
<all_train> ... vector from c-binding "X_train", "y_train", and "subject_train" data sets
<Test_Train> ... vector from r-binding "all_test" and "all_train"
<AllColNames> ... vector containing all assigned column names in data sets
<StandardMeans> ... vector that calculates mean and standard deviation of ""Test_Train" data set; will simplify the numerical data
<TableActivityNames> ... merged data set of "Test_Train" and "activity_labels"
<TidySet> ... aggregate of "StandardMeans", "TableActivityNames", and calculations to make one table
<TidySetTable> ... completed table with rows in proper order
